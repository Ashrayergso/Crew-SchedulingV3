Shared Dependencies:

1. Django Models: `CrewMember`, `Cert`, `Qualification`, `Ship`, `Positions`, `Assignment`, `ShipCrewAllowance`. These models are shared across various files like `models.py`, `views.py`, `admin.py`, and `migrations/0001_initial.py`.

2. Function: `assignCrewToShips`. This function is the core feature of the application and is likely to be used in `views.py` and possibly in `models.py` or `admin.py`.

3. Django Messages: "CREW_FETCH_SUCCESS", "SHIP_FETCH_SUCCESS", "ASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS", "ASSIGNMENT_FAILURE". These messages are likely to be used in `views.py` to display success or failure messages.

4. Django Templates: `base.html`, `home.html`, `crewmember_list.html`, `crewmember_detail.html`, `cert_list.html`, `cert_detail.html`, `qualification_list.html`, `qualification_detail.html`, `ship_list.html`, `ship_detail.html`, `positions_list.html`, `positions_detail.html`, `assignment_list.html`, `assignment_detail.html`, `shipcrewallowance_list.html`, `shipcrewallowance_detail.html`. These templates are shared across `views.py` and their respective HTML files.

5. CSS and JavaScript Files: `style.css`, `script.js`. These files are used in the Django templates for styling and interactivity.

6. URL Patterns: These are defined in `urls.py` and are used to map to the views defined in `views.py`.

7. Django Settings: The `settings.py` file is shared across the entire Django project and is used to configure the application.

8. Dependencies: The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies required for the project, which are shared across the entire project.

9. Installation Instructions: The `instructions.txt` file provides setup and installation instructions, which are relevant to the entire project.
